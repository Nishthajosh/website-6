<p>
By large, the Haiku Project is based on a 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meritocracy" target=”_blank” >meritocracy</a> -- the 
notion of people gaining prestige and influence in the project by making 
valuable contributions (whether it be code, documentation, or other recognized 
services to the project). However, there are also elements of a representative 
democracy, where the voting body will consider the thoughts of the larger user 
base of Haiku when making decisions. But there is no doubt that at the end of 
the day decisions are made by members of the meritocracy.
<p>
</p>
This general interest poll, is to allow you -- yes you! -- the opportunity 
to effectively express your thoughts on which features should be present in 
Haiku R1 (Final). For R1, a balance must be attained between delaying the 
release and making Haiku R1 a well polished, impressive and feature rich release.
<p>
</p>
This poll will remain open until Sunday December 12, 2010 (approximately 19:00 UTC). 
Afterwards, the results will be merged onto the 
<a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/wiki/FutureHaiku/Features">FutureHaiku/Features</a> wiki 
page on the <a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/" target=”_blank”  >Haiku Project's Development Tracker</a>.
A courtesy email will also be sent to the 
<a href="https://www.freelists.org/list/haiku-development">[haiku-development] mailing list</a>.
